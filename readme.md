# Anonymous MEVN organizer

Simple project to learn more about Vue and Express in general. For now it lets user access rooms by their IDs and create entries, mark them completed. 

Going to implement more options for to-dos, such as creating personal tables (something like Trello) and setting self-destruction timer on tasks and panels. Also going to work on appearance beacuse now it's kinda trash

## Getting started

* ` git clone `
* ` npm install `

And you good to go!
